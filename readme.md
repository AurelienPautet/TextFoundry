# TextFoundry
## Native AI Text Correction & Refinement for macOS

TextFoundry is a native macOS application that lets you refine, translate, and correct text in any application using a global hotkey. It is designed to be lightweight, privacy-focused, and model-agnostic.

This project is a complete rewrite and major improvement of my previous Java-based tool, "IA Corrector".
This is my very first app i vibe coded (using GeminiCLI)
